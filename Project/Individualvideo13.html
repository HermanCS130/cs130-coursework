                    Robert Wintemunte: Brexit Compromises Minority Rights
                </div>
                <div class="individual-description">
                    Robert Wintemute is frightened of the prospects of minority rights in Britain. He argues that any political majority in Parliament could take away minority rights at any time in a post-Brexit reality – and does not put much faith in Prime Minister May bearing such a responsibility.
                    Robert Wintemute is a Professor of Human Rights Law. He joined the Dickson Poon School of Law in 1991 after practising as an Associate in the Bankruptcy Department at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP in New York, 1982-87. In 1978, Professor Wintemute completed his BA in Economics at the University of Alberta (which included a year at Université Laval). In 1982, he earned his LLB (common law) and BCL (Québec civil law) in the National Programme at McGill University. In 1993, he was awarded his DPhil by the University of Oxford.
