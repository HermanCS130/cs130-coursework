                    Simon Glendinning: The European Identity
                </div>
                <div class="individual-description">
                    Is there such a thing as a European Identity? And If so, what is it? Simon Glendinning takes us through the components of the European Identity that supposedly continue to define the political landscape on the continent.
                    Professor Simon Glendinning has a BPhil and a DPhil in Philosophy from Oxford University. Today, he serves as Head of the European Institute and Professor in European Philosophy at the London School of Economics and Political Science. As he put it himself, Glendinning is still not clear whether philosophy is a complicated education for grown-ups or just a simple occupation for grown-ups who never made it beyond childhood.
