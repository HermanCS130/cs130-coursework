                    Mogens Lykketoft: Brexiteers Should Look for More Sovreignty within the EU
                </div>
                <div class="individual-description">
                    The former President of the United Nations General Assembly Mogens Lykketoft argues that Brexiteers misunderstand sovreignty. In the global context, the EU offers more power, not less.
                    Mogens Lykketoft has had a prominent career in Danish and international politics. In December 2002 he succeeded Poul Nyrup Rasmussen as party leader of the Social Democrats in Denmark. In the Cabinets of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen I, II, III and IV which governed from 1993 to 2001, he held positions as Finance Minister and Foreign Minister. During the cabinet of Helle Thorning Schmidt from 2011 to 2015 he was Speaker of the Danish Parliament, Folketinget. In June 2015 he was unanimously elected the President of the United Nations General Assembly presiding over the 70th session of the General Assembly beginning 15 September 2015.
