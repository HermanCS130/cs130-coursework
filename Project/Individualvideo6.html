                <div class="individual-description">
                    Happiness should be what policymaker orient themselves towards. It is, in a sense, the ultimate outcome of our every day, and it determines how we see ourselves in the world. At least according to Professor Paul Frijters.

                    Paul Frijters is a Professorial Research Fellow at the LSE and Project Director of the World Wellbeing Panel specializing in applied micro-econometrics, including labor, happiness, and health economics. Through his work, Professor Frijters has risen to become a prominent research economist and has published over 70 papers in fields including unemployment policy, discrimination, and economic development. Frijters was voted Australiaâ€™s best young economist under 40 by the Australian Economic Society.
